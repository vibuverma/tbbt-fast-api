# The Big Bang Theory API

Greetings, fellow intellects! I present to you the marvel of modern technology: The Big Bang Theory API. Bazinga!

This is not your average web application; it's a brilliant creation built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that serves data related to the TV show "The Big Bang Theory." Are you ready to embark on a journey through the fascinating world of Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, and the rest of the gang?

## Getting Started

Before we dive into this marvel of engineering, you'll need a few things.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- FastAPI (installed automatically via requirements.txt)
- A web browser

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this without any theoretical physics knowledge:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vibuverma/tbbt-fast-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory. Think of it as a quantum leap:

   ```bash
   cd tbbt-fast-api
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional, but it's like wearing a protective suit in a lab):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment. It's the equivalent of turning on your intellectual superpowers:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
5. Install the required dependencies. This part is so easy even Howard Wolowitz could do it:
 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Now that we've successfully set up the experiment, it's time to observe the results:
1. Start the FastAPI application. Don't worry; there won't be any explosions:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```
2. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to access the API documentation. You can interact with the endpoints there.

## Endpoints
- Get Seasons: Retrieve information about all seasons. Like Sheldon, it's comprehensive.
- Get Season by Number: Retrieve information about a specific season by providing its number.
- Get Episodes by Season: Get a list of episodes for a specific season. It's almost like Sheldon's meticulous whiteboard.
- Get Episode by Number: Retrieve information about a specific episode by providing the season and episode numbers. It's like going back in time to relive your favorite episodes.
- Get Cast Members: Get information about the cast members of the show. Sheldon would definitely want to analyze this data.
